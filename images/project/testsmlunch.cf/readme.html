<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>This is the first version of the lunch website. In my <a href="https://www.smhs.org/">high school</a>, the lunch
    schedule is confused especially for freshmen. So I created this website to help new students to learn my school's
    block schedule.</p>

<h4>Scenario: my school schedule<br /><small>how complex it is</small></h4>

<ul>
    <li><strong>15 different <a
                href="https://smhsorg.finalsite.com/uploaded/2019-2020_Calendar/2019-2020_SMCHS_Bell_Schedule.pdf?1560464424884">bell
                schdules</a></strong> including special schedules.</li>
    <li><strong>Rotating class periods:</strong> We take <abbr>7</abbr> classes, but one day only has time for
        <abbr>6</abbr> or <abbr>5</abbr> classes. So the next day starts with the class that is after the last class of
        the previous day. </li>
    <li><strong>First & Second Lunch:</strong> My school divides students into 2 lunches based on thier buildings of the
        third class of the day. Since our rotating schedule, the third class is changing. </li>
</ul>

<p>According to my teacher, they always have students going to the wrong lunch which causes an after school detention to
    the student. To solve this problem is my goal for this website. </p>

<h3>Frontend</h3>
<p>By watching lots of videos and login templates, I coded this login page, which is not very bad :) The user page,
    update page and sign up page follow this design style. Here are some images of those pages. </p>

    alt="signup_page" />

<img class="parallelImageRight" src="/images/project/testsmlunch.cf/update_page.png" alt="update_page" />

<img class="parallelImageRight" src="/images/project/testsmlunch.cf/user_page.png" alt="user_page" />
<img class="parallelImageRight parallelImageLeft" src="/images/project/testsmlunch.cf/update_page.png"
    alt="update_page" />

<h3 class="sectionBreaker">Backend</h3>
<p>It was a chanllenging part because it's my first time doing backend. In another word, I learned <abbr>php</abbr> and
    <abbr>mysql</abbr> by doing this project. I was very excited when the data got put into the mysql database by my php
    code.
    I was also luckily that <a href="https://www.000webhost.com/">000webhost</a> provides free mysql database service so
    I was able to host the webiste with no cost. </p>
<h4>Algorithm</h4>
<p>This algorithm explains how the lunch's determined by code. This task is done by <code>checklunch($room)</code>
    method, </p>
<figure class="highlight">
    <pre><code>function checklunch($room){
    if($room=='B'||$room=='b'||$room=='C'||$room=='c'||$room=='S'||$room=='s'){
      return 'First Lunch';
    } else if($room=='A'||$room=='a'||$room=='T'||$room=='t'||$room=='R'||$room=='r'||$room=='G'||$room=='g'){
      return 'Second Lunch';
    } else{
      return 'Building does not exist';
    }
}
</code>
            </pre>
</figure>

<p>The third period classes of the week is put in manually by me. This is a huge inconvenience of this website, and you
    will see how I fixed this in the <a href="/project/#smlunch.com">second version</a>. Here is code that I
    need to change every week. </p>
<figure class="highlight">
    <pre><code>$lunches = array('one','two','three','four','five');
$one_or_tow = array();
for($y = 0; $y <=4 ; $y++){
  $num = $lunches[$y];
  $one_or_tow[]= checklunch($periods[0][$num]);
}
</code>
            </pre>
</figure>

<p>After these process, the code will <code>echo</code> the HTML elements with either first or second lunch for each day
    of the week.</p>
<figure class="highlight">
    <pre><code>echo 'Hello '.$row['name'].' from ';

echo ' your friend Robin Gan';

echo '&lt;p class="lunch">Monday&lt;/p>'.$one_or_tow[0];
echo '&lt;p class="lunch">Tuesday&lt;/p>'.$one_or_tow[1];
echo '&lt;p class="lunch">Wednesday&lt;/p>'.$one_or_tow[2];
echo '&lt;p class="lunch">Thursday&lt;/p>'.$one_or_tow[3];
</code>
            </pre>
</figure>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Did it solve the problem?</h4>
<p>No, the login and sign up process was confusing to use because I didn't know much about the backend. Also, the
    update(third period classes) process is inefficient and can easily forget by the person
    who's doing this task. And the result could be serious, so I didn't introduce this to the school. Instead, I asked
    my classmates to test the website, and I
    got 60+ users and some good comments. ;)
</p>

<h4>Positive impact on me</h4>
<p>All in all, I did make a good start on my backend journey. This skill leads to some successful websites like <a
        href="/project/#frcscouting.ga" onclick="project_nav(this.innerText)">frcscouting.ga</a> and <a
        href="/project/#scope.com">scope.com</a></p>
