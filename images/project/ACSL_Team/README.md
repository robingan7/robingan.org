### Intro

I started an ACSL(America Computer Science League) team in October 2018.
It was the first year my school and my team participating in this. I was
excited but also nervous being the captain of the team. My team met
every two days for discussing algorithms.

### What is ACSL?

> ACSL organizes computer science contests and computer programming
> contests for elementary, junior, and senior high school students. This
> year, our 42nd year of continuous operation, over 300 teams in the
> United States, Canada, Europe, Africa, and Asia are participating in
> various divisions. ACSL is on the approved activities list of the
> National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP). ACSL is
> also an institutional member of the Computer Science Teachers
> Association. -- [ACSL](http://www.acsl.org/)

    in Senior-3 Division

#### Some algorithms I wrote

**FYI**: I just learn programming for 3 month when I entered this
contest. I didn't know any of the link lists, priority queues, recursion
and backtracing algorithms. So my code might look very silly to you.
However, I still want to show some of them so that you can see my
improvement each year.

-   [Hexgrid Path
    Generation](https://github.com/robingan7/ACSL/tree/master/practice%20contest%202018/Hexgrid_Path_Generator)
    :find a path with given length between two grids in hexagons.
-   [Skyscraper](https://github.com/robingan7/ACSL/tree/master/practice%20contest%202018/Skyscraper)
    :solve [Skyscrapers](https://brainbashers.com/skyscrapers.asp) game
    by python code.
-   [Palindrome](https://github.com/robingan7/ACSL/tree/master/practice%20contest%202018/Palindrome)
    :our team tryout problem. Adding two number(palindrome of each
    other) in a given base.
-   [Stretch](https://github.com/robingan7/ACSL/tree/master/season%202018-2019/contest3)
    :Given a rectangular grid and the 5 types of pieces shown below, the
    object of Stretch is to place pieces in the grid so that they form a
    connected path across the grid. If the initial piece is in the
    leftmost column, the path goes to the rightmost column. If the
    initial piece is in the rightmost column, the path goes to the
    leftmost column.
