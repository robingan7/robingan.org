<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>Strongly recommend reading this <a href="/media/#Why_do_scouting_apps_matter?">blog</a>, where I talk about how
    scouting works in <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FRC(First Robotics Competition)</a> events
    and the significance of a working scouting website or app for a team. </p>
<p>It's the mother of <a href="/project/#Scope">Scope</a>. It has scouting forms that are specific for FRC
    competition <strong>2019</strong>. It is easy to use and can analyze data, rank teams, make charts from data user
    scout. It saved lots of time from putting data in excel then sorting data. It worked very well in 2019 season in my
    <a href="https://smblyrequired.com">team</a>.</p>
<h4>How did I start</h4>
<p>There was one night, my robotics mentors were talking about how nice it will be if we had a scouting app last year. I
    heard their talking so I jumped in and said I will make one. So that became my new project. I made it from scratch
    using multiple languages. It took me 4 months to finish it since I was the only web developer on the team.</p>
<p>The domain <strong>frcscouting.ga</strong> was expired December 8, 2019. So the website is on its original domain -
    <strong><a href="https://frcscouting.000webhostapp.com">https://frcscouting.000webhostapp.com</a></strong>.</p>
<h3>Frontend</h3>
<h4>Toggle pages website</h4>
<p>I was planning to do a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">single page website</a>.
    However, <strong>I think I comprehended the concept wrong.</strong> The website turned out to be an interface with
    some toggle <abbr>div</abbr>, which worked fine but you can't call it a single-page website. The code looks like
    this,</p>
<figure class="highlight">
    <pre><code>function toggleEdit(cls) {
    let ele = document.getElementById(cls);
    ele.classList.toggle('active');
}

function toggleChoose(cls) {
    let ele = document.getElementById(cls);
    ele.classList.toggle('active');
}

function toggleChart(cls) {
    let ele = document.getElementById(cls);
    ele.classList.toggle('active');
}
</code>
            </pre>
</figure>

<h4>The 4 sections</h4>
<p>There are 4 parts in frontend design,</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Teams:</strong> compare teams data in tables and graphs. For genrating graphs out of the data, I
            tried <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/">chart.js</a> API which worked very well. <strong>All the tables in
                this projects is coded from scratch</strong>, I wish I used more API that would save me tons of time of
            binding data into compatible <abbr>HTML</abbr>. </p>
        <img class="parallelImageRight parallelImageLeft" src="/images/project/frcscouting.ga/chart.gif"
            alt="compare" />
        <img class="parallelImageRight " src="/images/project/frcscouting.ga/compare.gif" alt="chart" />
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Explore:</strong> this page is where scouts view ranking and most of the data from scouting in
            events. The users are able to switch between <abbr>by Matchs</abbr> and <abbr>by Teams</abbr> by clicking
            the buttons. It also got tables with fixed <abbr>Team Number</abbr> column. Although
            the color is a little bit odd, it is easy to read. The embed <a href="https://www.thebluealliance.com/">Blue
                Alliance</a> page saved scouts time from switching between tabs. </p>
        <img src="/images/project/frcscouting.ga/explore.gif" alt="explore" />
    </li>

    <li>
        <p><strong>Update info:</strong></p> When you click on <abbr>Update Info</abbr>, a small window asking for
        <code>Edit Code</code> should pop up. The password is <code>3</code>, and the verifying is done by
        <abbr>javascript</abbr> so you can find out the password if you inspect the web page.
        I made it this way because I really didn't know that users can view all the HTML, CSS and JS code. &#128517;</p>
        <img src="/images/project/frcscouting.ga/password.png" alt="password" />
        <p>Once you submit the correct password, it should take you to this page below. The two blue buttons are used
            for adding data. And all the green buttons are data added and can be edited by scouts. </p>
        <img src="/images/project/frcscouting.ga/update_info.png" alt="update_info" />

        <p><code>Add New Match</code> & <code>Add Team</code> contains two forms I designed for <abbr>pit
                scouting</abbr> & <abbr>match scouting</abbr>. They're the most important part of this website becasue
            they're where scouts entered
            all the data.</p>
        <img class="parallelImageRight" src="/images/project/frcscouting.ga/teamForm.gif" alt="teamForm" />
        <img class="parallelImageRight parallelImageLeft" src="/images/project/frcscouting.ga/matchForm.gif"
            alt="matchForm" />
        <p>Scouts from my team really like the rocket and cargoship in the match form because they were very easy to use
            and recognize.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>About us:</strong> just a link to our team <a href="https://smblyrequired.com/">website</a>.</p>
    </li>

</ul>

<h3>Backend</h3>
<p>It is the second website I made that requires <abbr>backend</abbr>. Like the frontend in <a
        href="/project/#robingan.ga">robingan.ga</a>, I wasted lots of time writing inefficient and messy code. Luckily,
    they worked but it is impossible for other people
    to maintain the website. But I learned from my mistakes, and all the problems are fixed in the new version -- <a
        href="/project/#Scope">frc-scope.com</a></p>

<h4>Highlight</h4>
<p>Second time worked with <abbr>MYSQL</abbr> database & <abbr>PHP</abbr>. This website contains a lot of regular
    inserting, adding and editing data. I won't talk about these parts, instead, I will focus on
    <strong>chart.js</strong> API and <strong>mulit-columns sorting</strong>, which
    are two interesting topics for this project.</p>

<h4>Chart.js API</h4>
<p>As you see in <abbr>fronend</abbr> part of this article, the website can graphing the data(such as total cargo point)
    of <abbr>a specific ability</abbr> of <abbr>a specific data(such as total cargo point)</abbr> in a <abbr>a specific
        event</abbr>. This neat graph API is called <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/">chart.js</a>.
</p>

<p><strong>First,</strong> I put <code>event listener</code> on each <abbr>select bar</abbr> to send value to
    <code><a href="https://github.com/robingan7/frcscouting.ga/blob/6aced12a6bc93109d2a8f9805c08d3841f5431a3/pass_load_part.js#L30">load_graph(teamNumber, region, data)</a></code>
    method,</p>
<figure class="highlight">
    <pre><code>//team number 
$('#chteamnumber').change(function () {
    var con1 = $('#chteamnumber').val();
    var con2 = $('#chregion').val();
    var con3 = $('#chfeature').val();
    load_graph(con1, con2, con3);
});

//region
$('#chregion').change(function () {
    var con1 = $('#chteamnumber').val();
    var con2 = $('#chregion').val();
    var con3 = $('#chfeature').val();
    load_graph(con1, con2, con3);
});

//data type such as total cargo point
$('#chfeature').change(function () {
    var con1 = $('#chteamnumber').val();
    var con2 = $('#chregion').val();
    var con3 = $('#chfeature').val();
    load_graph(con1, con2, con3);
});
</code>
            </pre>
</figure>

<p><strong>Second</strong>,
    <code><a href="https://github.com/robingan7/frcscouting.ga/blob/6aced12a6bc93109d2a8f9805c08d3841f5431a3/pass_load_part.js#L30">load_graph(teamNumber, region, data)</a></code>
    method sends data to
    <code><a href="https://github.com/robingan7/frcscouting.ga/blob/master/graph.php">graph.php</a></code>, which
    queries data from mysql database, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29">ajax</a>.
    After it gets responses from database, it displays the graphs on the screen.</p>
<figure class="highlight">
    <pre><code>function load_graph(teamNumber, region, data) {
    $.ajax({
        url: "graph.php",
        method: "POST",
        data: {
            teamNumber: teamNumber,
            region: region,
            data: data
        },
        success: function (data) {
            $('#graphresult').html(data);
        }
    });
}
</code>
            </pre>
</figure>

<p><strong>Finally</strong>,
    <code><a href="https://github.com/robingan7/frcscouting.ga/blob/master/graph.php">graph.php</a></code> queries from
    databae and converts the data into <abbr>JSON</abbr> that <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/">chart.js</a> can read.
    It responses to
    <code><a href="https://github.com/robingan7/frcscouting.ga/blob/6aced12a6bc93109d2a8f9805c08d3841f5431a3/pass_load_part.js#L30">load_graph(teamNumber, region, data)</a></code>
    method
    as soon as it gets the result. </p>
<figure class="highlight">
    <pre><code>//query data from database
$query = /* sql query statement */;
$result = mysqli_query($conn, $query);
$result2 = mysqli_query($conn, $query);

while ($row = mysqli_fetch_array($result)) {
    $data1 = $data1 . '"'. $row[$con3].'",';
}

while ($row2 = mysqli_fetch_array($result2)) {
    $data2 = $data2 . '"Match '. 
             $row2["matchnumber"].'",';
}

//convert data in chart.js format
$data1 = trim($data1, ",");   
$data2 = trim($data2, ",");
 
$output='
&lt;div class="chart-container" style="">    
&lt;canvas id="myChart">&lt;/canvas>
&lt;/div>
&lt;script src="Chart.min.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;script>

//myChart is a DOM element
var ctx = myChart.getContext("2d");
var myChart = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: "line",
    data: {
        labels: ['.$data2.'],
        datasets: [{
            label: "'.$con1." ".$con2." "
                    .$con3.'",
            data: ['.$data1.'],
            backgroundColor:  "black",
            borderColor:"black",
            borderWidth: 2,
            pointBackgroundColor:"yellow"
        }]
    },
    options: {
        scales: {
            yAxes: [{
                ticks: {
                    beginAtZero:true
                }
            }]
        }
    }
});
&lt;/script>';
}

//response to load_graph method
echo $output;
}
</code>
            </pre>
</figure>
<h4>Mulit-columns Sorting</h4>
<p>In explore page, you might notice there're three selects bars on top. They're for mulitple sorting, which gives more
    options on ranking and evaluating team data.</p>
<p>Here
    is how it works. The first select bar on the left is first priority data(I called it <abbr>conditon1</abbr>), the
    rest of two become second proioity and third proioity data.
    When you select the first bar, the data you want will move to the first column. In this pattern, <abbr>second
        data</abbr> will move the second column, and <abbr>third data</abbr> will move to the thrid column. Like this,
</p>

<p><img src="/images/project/frcscouting.ga/mutliple_column.gif" alt="mutliple_column" /></p>

<p>The way of sending requests to database is same as <abbr>chart.js</abbr> implementation, which includes using
    <code><a href="https://github.com/robingan7/frcscouting.ga/blob/6aced12a6bc93109d2a8f9805c08d3841f5431a3/explorepage.inc.php#L19">load_rank(con1,con2,con3)</a></code>.
    So I will only explain
    the PHP part --
    <code><a href="https://github.com/robingan7/frcscouting.ga/blob/master/loadrank.php">loadrank.php</a></code>. </p>

<p>This is query command to the database,</p>
<figure class="highlight">
    <pre><code>//SQL query command
$query = "SELECT * FROM teams ORDER BY `teams`.`$condition1` DESC, `$condition2` DESC, `$condition3` DESC;";
</code>
            </pre>
</figure>

<p>But of the the speical cases is that the user might not choose three data, sometimes they only choose the first two
    or the last two. So the code need to be able to handle this case. I was kind of smart that I created a
    <code>nothing</code>
    column in my database table. Every row has the same value in that column so that it doesn't do anything in ranking.
    The code becomes this,</p>
<figure class="highlight">
    <pre><code>//SQL query command
if($con1 == ""){
    $con1 = "nothing";
}
if($con2 == ""){
    $con2 = "nothing";
}
if($con3 == ""){
    $con3 = "nothing";
}
$query = /* sql query statement */;
</code>
            </pre>
</figure>

<p>After that, I used a <code>for loop</code> to generate <abbr>HTML</abbr> with data, which is also the result to
    <code><a href="https://github.com/robingan7/frcscouting.ga/blob/6aced12a6bc93109d2a8f9805c08d3841f5431a3/explorepage.inc.php#L19">load_rank(con1,con2,con3)</a></code>.
</p>
<figure class="highlight">
    <pre><code>$output .= '&lt;/tr>';
$fetchArray = mysqli_fetch_array($result);
while($rows = $fetchArray){
    $output .= '&lt;tr>';
    foreach ($final as $col_name){
        if($col_name == "teamnumber"){
            $output .= '&lt;th class="lock">'.
                        $rows[$col_name].
                        '&lt;/th>';
            $tnum = $rows[$col_name];
            $sq = /* sql query statement */;
            $qry = mysqli_query($conn, $sq);
            $ros = mysqli_num_rows($qry);
        }else{
            $totalNum = $rows[$col_name];
            $in = $totalNum / $ros;
            $output .= '&lt;th class="normal">'.
                        $in.'&lt;/th>';
        }
    }
$output .= '&lt;/tr>';
}
echo $output;
</code>
            </pre>
</figure>

<h3>Things I will(have to) improve next time</h3>
<ul>
    <li>This project contains too much <strong>duplicated code</strong>, even after I cleaned up the code twice last
        year.</li>
    <li>The coding style is super messy. </li>
    <li>There is no directory in this project(all the files are in the same folder as <code>index.php</code>.), which
        gives me a hard time every time I want to find a file. </li>
    <li>Overused <code>echo</code> in <abbr>PHP</abbr>, data binding should be neater. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Xcode Version(Apple APP)</h4>
<p>Here is the <a href="https://github.com/robingan7/frcscouting.ga-Xcode">code</a>. Xcode version of frcscouting.ga,
    basically displaying sub page of the website version in each tab. I didn't publish it because I didn't want to pay
    $100 developer fee. </p>
