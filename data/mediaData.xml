            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>In the <a href="https://www.thebluealliance.com/event/2019cabb">2019 battle at the border</a> FRC off-season event, I drove the robot I programmed for the first time in an actual match. Although I didn't drive well, I still understand how the event work by being a part of the drive team. Here are some videos and pictures from the event.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>This is probably the last time I drive the robot in a FRC contest, so I'm very enjoy the experience. Here are some things I learned by being on the drive team, </p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>driving the robot is much harder than I thought. </p></li>
                <li><p>fully understanding the code from last year. </p></li>

            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>This is one of the <a href="https://www.smhs.org/academics/departments-and-courses/science/robotics">robotics</a> projects I've been working on for 3 month. I did research on <a href="https://github.com/Team254/FRC-2019-Public/tree/master/src/main/java/com/team254/frc2019/loops">254 library</a>. And I successfully converted our robot code from last year to this 
            multi-threading structure.</p>

            <h4>What is multi-threading</h4>
            <blockquote>
            <p>In computer architecture, multithreading is the ability of a central processing unit (CPU) (or a single core in a multi-core processor) to provide <strong>multiple threads of execution concurrently</strong>, supported by the operating system. This approach differs from multiprocessing. In a multithreaded application, the threads share the <strong>resources of a single or multiple cores</strong>, which include the computing units, the CPU caches, and the translation lookaside buffer (TLB).
                (from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multithreading_(computer_architecture)">wikipedia</a>)
            </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Bascially, it activates the multiple cores in <a href="https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/model.roborio.html">roboRIO</a> so that we can have more efficient updating and writing outputs.</p>

            <h4>How did I start this?</h4>
            <p>When <a href="/media/#FRC_Houston_Champ_2019">I went Houston Championship</a> in April, 2019, I noticed <a href="https://www.team254.com/">team 254</a> had crazy good autonomous period. So I went to their section on the stand and talked with their lead programmer. It was a helpful conversation, and I started to learn their code on <a href="https://github.com/Team254">github</a>. 
                Multi-threading structure is just a part of their code. I still need to figure out the autonomous algorithm. 
            </p>

            <h3>What I achieved so far</h3>
            <p>I've been pushing updates on this <a href="https://github.com/robingan7/frc5805_2020CodeDemo">repo</a>, which will be our code for next year. Here is what I finished and learned so far, </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Working multi-threading system that can do the same thing as the <a href="/project/#FRC_2019_Public">command base</a> structure from last year. </li>

                <li>Action class ready to go(not test yet)</li>
                <li>Motion Profile ready to go(not test yet)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why this is crucial?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Our robot will be getting and writing data faster. </li>
                <li><strong>Now we have the potential to have the autonomous like 254.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <h4>My biggest goal this year</h4>
            <p>First fully autonomous robot in FRC history.</p>

            It was the night before my <a href="https://www.thebluealliance.com/event/2019cabb">robotics tournament</a>, which I <a href="/media/#First_time_being_a_robot_driver">drove the robot for the first time</a> in competition. </p>

            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>This performance was on <abbr>2019.7.29</abbr>. My performance(<abbr>non-profit</abbr>) during 2019 summer session at <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford</a>, it was my first rap live performance so I was very nervous on the stage. However, it was still an awesome experience. Shout out to <a href="https://summer.stanford.edu/">Stanford Summer Session</a> for hosting this event.</p>
            <p><img src="/images/media/My_FIRST_live_rap_performance/Robin Gan in the house.png" alt="Robin Gan in the house" /></p>
            <h3>Raps I did</h3>
            <p>The rap was a <abbr>remix</abbr> of <strong> Call Me Robin(Prod by Young Forever)</strong> and <strong>To16</strong>.</p></br>
            <h4>Call Me Robin(Prod by Young Forever)</h4>
            <p>This is the rap that I composed for this event. I'm not a social person, so people hardly know me from conversation with me. However, 
                the hook <abbr>"Call me, Call me, Call me, Call me, Call me, ROBIN!!"</abbr> made everyone who went to that show remember my name. 
            </p>
            <p>My voice and lyrics are not very clear in the video<small>(maybe because I was nervous and didn't rap clearly)</small>. I will make a studio version later, and it will be available <a href="/music">here</a> with more details on this rap. 
            </p>
            <p>I combined some fast <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_music">trap</a> flows in the rap, thus, it was a tough show to rap it with limited backup. I could hardly breath on the stage since I was jumping around while rapping this flow. As a result, When I rap the second verse, 
            I was a little ahead than my backup. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lyrics by <a href="/">Robin Gan</a></li>
                <li>beat by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDpcgy02bcqxZMEaQIQw6pQ">Young Foreover</a></li>
            </ul>

            <h4>to16</h4>
            <p>The reason why this rap is called <strong>to16</strong> is that I wrote this rap on my 16th birthday. It's a slow old school rap, and it includes my stories when I just came to US and how I got to know Hiphop and started to
            rap. Like the previous rap, I will make a studio version later. And it will be available <a href="/music">here</a> with more details on this rap.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lyrics by <a href="/">Robin Gan</a></li>
                <li>beat: I found this beat long time ago. It said it was a free beat. But I still want to credit the artist. <a href="mailto:robinganmusic@gmail.com?Subject=Hello%20Robin">Email me</a> if you recognize the beat and know who the artist is.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>I'm talking about the significance of scouting apps and websites in teams of <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">First Robotics Competition</a>.</p>
            <p>First, let me intro the official definition of <strong>scout</strong>,</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>1: to explore an area to obtain information (as about an enemy).<br/>2. a: to make a search.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b: to work as a talent scout.
            </br> -- <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/scouts">Merriam Webster</a></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>In <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">First Robotics Competition</a>, scouting plays an important role in <a href="http://clickfrc.org/competition/at-the-event/alliance-selection/">alliance selection</a>, where top 8 teams(ranked by their <abbr>ranking points</abbr> earned in <abbr>qualification matches</abbr>) choose two alliance partners to join their alliance to compete in playoff matches. 
            Here is an  <a href="http://clickfrc.org/competition/at-the-event/alliance-selection/">article</a> that has more details on this.</p>

            <h3>What are scouts' tasks in a FRC event?<br/><small>by event timeline</small></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Day 1:</strong> all teams are setting up their pits for their robots. After this process is done, the scouts will start <abbr>the pit scout</abbr>. This kind of scouting includes 
                    <ul>
                        <li> going to other team's pits and greeting the students there,</li>
                        <li> asking questions about their robot abilities(for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mew6G_og-PI">2019 game</a>, an example can be <abbr>what level can you robot climb?</abbr>) </li>
                        <li> and their strategy for matches,</li>
                        <li> and team backup support(like <abbr>how many batteries do you have</abbr>?)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Day 2:</strong> this day usually contains most of the qualification matches which teams randomly partner up to form alliances. Teams can still do pit scout on this day. But the most important 
                task for scouts on this day is taking data from the robots' performances while watching the qualification matches. And this is the part that scouting app will help a lot. I will explain this later in this blog. 
                One scout usually looks at <abbr>1</abbr> robot per match. For <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mew6G_og-PI">2019 game</a>, scouts can keep tracking data like, 
                <ul>
                    <li>how many cargos did this robot scored?</li>
                    <li>how many hatches did this robot scored?</li>
                    <li>what level did this robot climb in the end game?</li>
                </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Day 3:</strong> this is the day that <a href="http://clickfrc.org/competition/at-the-event/alliance-selection/">alliance selection</a> happens. The teams that are in position to pick will use their data from scouts to make 
                decision. This process is very important for an alliance's success. </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Scouting technology</h3>
            <p>By asking question and observing how other teams scout from last year, I found out that most teams are using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel">excel</a>, 
            <a href="https://www.google.com/forms/about/">Google Form</a> and <a href="http://team358.org/history/2012/workfiles/">physical paper(scouting sheets)</a>. </p>
            <p><img src="/images/media/Why_do_scouting_apps_matter/scout_sheet.png" alt="scout_sheet" /></p>

            <p>Those methods for storing data work, but it takes foreover for the scout team to collect, analyze the data. I've seen teams flipping through a stack of scout sheets to put data in 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel">excel</a>. Then, they use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel">excel</a> to rank and do other analyzations to the data.   
            </p>

            <p>A <abbr>good</abbr> scouting app or website will have a customized user interface so that the one thing the scouts need to do is to put data in the app, and the app will do all the analyzation works. 
            Moreover, since the <abbr>forms</abbr> will be customized for competition, it will be much <abbr>easier</abbr> for scouts to enter data. Thus, those apps and websites are perfect for both <abbr>pit & match</abbr> scouting.</p>

            <h4>Scouting website we(frc5805) use</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><p><strong>This year<span>2019</span>:</strong> <a href="http://u880691907-robingan-org.hostingerapp.com/">Scope</a> by <a href="/">me</a>. It's the first online Scouting App For All FRC Teams, also the <strong>most convenient and functional scouting website in FRC.</strong> Here is a detailed <a href="/project/#Scope">project description</a>.</p></li> 
                <li><p><strong>Last year<span>2018</span>:</strong> <a href="https://frcscouting.000webhostapp.com">Big Yoshi Scout</a> by <a href="/">me</a>. It's the mother of <a href="/project/#Scope">Scope</a>. It has scouting forms that are specific for FRC competition 2019. It is easy to use and can analyze data, rank teams, make charts from data user scout. It saved lots of time from putting data in excel then sorting data. It worked very well in 2019 season in my team. Here is a detailed <a href="/project/#frcscouting.ga">project description</a>.</p></li>

            <![CDATA[
             <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p><a href="https://membean.com">Membean</a> is the website that my <a href="https://www.smhs.org/">school</a> uses for students to learn vocabulary. It counts 15% as my English grade. This part includes sessions where students spend at least an hour per week answering questions and quiz which is generated by membean based on the vocab you've learned. 
            Recently I found a potential bug in the website and wrote code that completed questions for me. The details are as follow.</p>
            <h3>How I started this</h3>
            <p>There was one night, I accidentally search <code>membean hack</code> on youtube. In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nWrstVqaiM">video</a>, 
            the person finds the pass button by removing the stylesheet of membean session page. So I was inspired by this
            , and planned to write a code to automatically answer questions correctly. </p>
​
            <h3>Algorithm</h3>
            <p>According to the video, the person simply clicks the <strong>pass</strong> button to get the next question. So
            I simply used <code>.click( )</code> method to replace clicking it manually. Here is an example,</p>
            <figure class="highlight"><pre><code>answerBtn.click();

document.getElementById('next-btn').click();</code> </pre> </figure>
            <p>In membean session, there are two type of questions. One of them is multiple choice question. The website will take the user 
            to the next question if the answer is correct.</p> 
            <p><img src="/images/media/Found_a_membean_bug/multipleChoice.png" alt="multipleChoice" /></p>
​
            <p>If the answer is wrong, the website will take the user to a review question, where the user needs to choose the right definition the word that the user did wrong. And this type also occurs when there is a new word for the user to learn. Moreover, the user has as many chances to get the type of question right. After the user chooses the right choice. They need to click a <strong>NEXT</strong> 
            button to view the next question.</p>
            <p><img src="/images/media/Found_a_membean_bug/reviewQuestion.png" alt="reviewQuestion" /></p>
​
            <h4>Solution<span>I'm not showing entire code due to security issue</span></h4>
            <ul>
                <li class="li-pre"><p>Checking question type</p></li>
                <figure class="highlight"><pre><code>var isFinsh = document.getElementById('interstitial');

if (isFinsh == null) {
    var formName = document.getElementsByTagName('form')[1];
​
    if (formName.name = "Next") {

    }else if (formName.name == "Pass") {

    }
} else {

}</code> </pre> </figure>   
                <li class="li-pre"><p>Answering Multiple Choice</p></li>
                <figure class="highlight"><pre><code>document.getElementById('pass').click();</code> </pre> </figure>   

                <li class="li-pre"><p>Answering Review Question</p></li>
                <figure class="highlight"><pre><code>answerBtn.click();

document.getElementById('next-btn').click();</code> </pre> </figure>   

                <li class="li-pre"><p>Finsh when the alert shows up</p></li>
                <figure class="highlight"><pre><code>document.getElementById('Click_me_to_stop').click();</code> </pre> </figure>   
            </ul>

            <h3>Does it work?</h3>
            <h4>Yes</h4>
            <p>It did do questions for me. </p>
            <h4>& No</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>it showed <abbr>cheating</abbr> on my teacher's account.</li>
                <li>And I got <abbr>40</abbr> new words while testing this code, which will be more work when studying for vocab quiz.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Result</h3>
            <p>In the next day, I emailed membean about this bug. And they replied to me that they will do the same test and encourage me
                keep programming &#128513;
            </p>
            <p>Shout out to this awesome company! </p>

                <h3>Intro</h3>
                <p>I joined <a href="https://smblyrequired.com/">SMbly Required</a> in 2018, which was my Sophomore year in <a href="https://www.smhs.org/">HS</a>. I had a very fun building and competition season. Now
                this is a recap of what I did in my first FRC season. Here are some blogs for some specific tournaments, </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="/media/#FRC_OC_Regional_2019">2019 OC Regional</a></li>
                    <li><a href="/media/#FRC_LA_North_Regional_2019">2019 LA North Regional</a></li>
                    <li><a href="/media/#FRC_Houston_Champ_2019">2019 Houston Championship</a></li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Pre-season<span>Sep 2018 - Dec 2018</span></h3>
                <p>Before building season, I was basically learning the whole time when I was at the meeting. I joined team in August with this email</p>
                <p><img src="/images/media/FRC_Season_2019/email.png" alt="email"/></p>
                <p>Then after school, I went to the classroom and met <a href="https://github.com/andrewd30">Andrew</a>--the only programmer was on the team.
                I was very sure I will be doing programming. So he showed me the <a href="https://github.com/robingan7/FRC-2018-Public">code</a> from last year.
                I was surprised how different it was from the <a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/course">Java</a> I known. I spent most of my time learning Java libraries like 
                <a href="https://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/release/docs/java/">WPILIB</a> & <a href="https://phoenix-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">
                ETRE</a> to be ready for building season.</p>

                <h3>2019 Season<span>Jan 2019 - Apr 2019</span></h3>
                <h4>Highlight Of Our <a href="https://smblyrequired.com">Design</a></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Double Chain System: </strong>it keeps our manipulator horizontal with the 
                    ground in different positions of our arm. This design save lots of time in programming. Shout
                    out to <a href="https://github.com/andrewd30">Andrew</a> and Aidan</li>

                    <li><strong>Line Light Aligning: </strong>it was our first experience with <a href="https://limelightvision.io/">lime light</a> camera, which save lots of time to 
                    build our own vision system. Also, thanks to my team's rich enough to get one. I worked on the <a href="https://github.com/robingan7/FRC-2019-Public/blob/master/src/main/java/frc/robot/commands/VisionDrive.java">code</a>
                     and made a working vision tracking drivebase in the second week as shown in this 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL1M6FNSRWc">video</a>,
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qL1M6FNSRWc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Held Button Control: </strong>during match, our operator is able to switch six different positions with four buttons on the joystick. 
                        <img src="/images/media/FRC_Season_2019/Testing the robot with Andrew.jpg" alt="Testing the robot with Andrew"/>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>LED Driver Signal: </strong>By using <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>, I was able to control LED's color based on the robot states to drivers
                        signal during match. For example, the LED will turn red if the arm is moving so that the driver knows the state of robot. However, we didn't have enough space
                        on our <a href="https://www.andymark.com/products/voltage-regulator-module">Voltage Regulator Module</a> to wire this Arduino, so we ended up not using it, but I 
                        still keep the <a href="https://github.com/robingan7/FRC-2019-Public/blob/master/src/main/java/frc/robot/subsystems/Arduino.java">code</a> 
                        and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvAwRCbZrN4">video</a> of this.

                        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kvAwRCbZrN4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>  
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        I explained more specifically on highlights of the code in this <a href="/project/#FRC5805_2019">project</a>.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="sectionBreaker">Things We Can Improve</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>I'm not satisfied with the coding style.</li>
                    <li>Autonomous is not working.</li>
                    <li>The robot design can fit the lime light more. The arm this year sometimes blocks lime light view. Also, because
                     the arm, the lime light camera can't be mounted in the center.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Hello...</h3>
            <p>Hi. I'm Robin. This is my first blog. I'm very excited to present you this website. I coded it from scratch and used some design from <a href="https://codepen.io/"> codepen</a>. I coded the first version of robingan.org(<a href="https://robinwebsite7.000webhostapp.com/">robingan.ga</a>) in November of <abbr>2018</abbr>. At that time, I only learned about programming for <abbr>4</abbr> months, so I was completely new to web programming. I looked up lots of videos on<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheCharmefis"> youtube</a> and realized how easy it is to code a website. And I was very passionate about making my personal web page. </p>
            <h4>Time Line of robingan.org</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>2018.11: </strong>start to work on this website(called robingan.ga at that time).</li>
                <li><strong>2018.12: </strong>main layout was done.<img src="/images/media/First_Blog.../mainlayout.png"/ alt="mainlayout"/></li>
                <li><strong>2019.5: </strong>add php and sorting function on project page</li>
                <li><strong>2019.7: </strong>add grid layout and sql for storing story and project page data.</li>
                <li><strong>2019.8: </strong>realize the old one look bad and start working on this new version.</li>
                <li><strong>2019.9: </strong><a href="/">robingan.org</a> the new version is done.<img src="/images/media/First_Blog.../robingan.org.png"/ alt="robingan.org"/></li>
                <li><strong>2019.10: </strong>most blogs and projects content were put in.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Enjoy your journey here...</h3>
