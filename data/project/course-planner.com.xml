            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>
                It's a website that helps teachers plan their teaching schedule faster and better. When I made this 
                website, I was also trying out new langauge, database, and js framework I've never used before such as 
                <a href="https://reactjs.org/">react</a>, <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">mongodb</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/">nodejs</a>. I learned them by watching some youtube video. 
            </p>
            <h4>Why I made this project</h4>
            <p>My physics teacher told me that they used to have a course planning website that binds with the textbooks. However, 
                the app was stopped for some reason, so he asked me if I can make a website with similar functions. Then I started making this. 
            </p>

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <h4>Google Login</h4>
            <p>This was the first I dealed with <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in">google login api</a>, which allows users to sign up and login with 
            their google accounts. </p>
            <p><img src="/images/project/course-planner.com/googlelogin.png" alt="googlelogin" /></p>

            <h4>Scheduler API</h4>
            <p>This was first time when I realized how convenient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">APIs</a> are and how much time they can save for me. For this project, 
                I used <a href="https://devexpress.github.io/devextreme-reactive/react/scheduler/">React Scheduler</a> api for displaying the caldenar and rendering 
                data to the caldenar. 
            </p>

            <h4>Importing textbook</h4>
            <p>The leading feature of this website is that the teachers can import schedule by selecting the textbooks they are using. 
                To accomplish this feature, my friend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yuhan525/">Yuhan</a> and I manually put in the textbook data into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a> file, 
                which looks like this. 
            </p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code>"Physics": [
    {
        "chapterName": "Ch.1 Science of Physics",
        "subChapter": [
            {

    }

            <h4>Auto-adjust</h4>
            <p>The auto-adjust feature makes it possible for teacher to move back one class, and then all the classes 
                behind that class will all remove back. The algorithm can <abbr>recursively</abbr> get the next valid data for each plan
                 with the code below.  
            </p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code>getValidDay(date, editSchedule, period, resultList) {
    if (!this.isONAnOffDay(date, editSchedule, period, resultList)) {
        return new Date(date);
    }
    let nextDay = getNextDay(new Date(date));
    return this.getValidDay(
        getCurrentDate(nextDay) + "T" + DEFAULT_STARTTIME,
        editSchedule, period, resultList);
}
</code>
            </pre>
            </figure>
            <h4>Combine with school schedule</h4>
            <p>I also used the schedule data from <a href="https://github.com/robingan7/course-planner.com/blob/master/client/src/data/schedules/smchs.js">seeyourschedule.com</a>. So the algorithm won't 
            put plans on weekends, and the days that doesn't have the class the teacher selects(for my high school, we don't have all the classes everyday). </p>
