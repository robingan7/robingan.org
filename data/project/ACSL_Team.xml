            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>I started an ACSL(America Computer Science League) team in October 2018. It was the first year my school and my team participating in this. I was excited but also nervous being the captain of the team. My team met every two days for discussing algorithms.</p>

            <h3>What is ACSL?</h3>
            <blockquote>
            <p>ACSL organizes computer science contests and computer programming contests for elementary, junior, and senior high school students. This year, our 42nd year of continuous operation, over 300 teams in the United States, Canada, Europe, Africa, and Asia are participating in various divisions. ACSL is on the approved activities list of the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP). ACSL is also an institutional member of the Computer Science Teachers Association.

            <h3>2018-2019 Season</h3>
            <h4>Award<br/><small>we lost 3 points due to a mistake in score counting.</small></h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Global rank: </strong><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/acsl-leaderboard/sr3?authuser=0">28th</a> in Senior-3 Division</li>
                <li><strong>California rank: </strong><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/acsl-leaderboard/sr3?authuser=0">2nd</a> in Senior-3 Division</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Some algorithms I wrote</h4>
            <p><strong>FYI</strong>: I just learn programming for 3 month when I entered this contest. I didn't know any of the link lists, priority queues, recursion and backtracing algorithms. So 
                my code might look very silly to you. However, I still want to show some of them so that you can see my improvement each year.
