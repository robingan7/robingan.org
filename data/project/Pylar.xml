        <h3>Why we made this project</h3>
        <p>Pylar is a project we're launching that seeks to automate composting with the integration of IOT and machine learning functionality. Since we know most people lead busy lives, maintaining a well kept compost pile can be time consuming: Pylar will offer a smooth platform that allows the clients to quickly monitor and gauge compost health at a glance, while also taking care of most of the process for our clients. </p>
        <p><img src="/images/project/Pylar/logo.jpg" alt="logo"/></p>
        <p>We initially created Pylar, since we were interested in finding ways to help the environment, such as  global warming, climate change, and pollution, and to promote sustainability through technology. 
        </p>
        <h4>My role</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Co-Founder</li>
            <li>Frontend Developer</li>
            <li>Backend Developer</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <h4>Receiving data from hardware</h4>
        <p>We need to find a way to send data from our hardware to the web app. Alex chose to use a <abbr>ESP8266 WIFI Microcontroller</abbr> 
        to send requests to our server. And my job was to write code to receive the request and display the data on the website. After some searches on Google, 
        I successfully used <abbr>PHP</abbr> to achieve the goal. </p>
        <p><img src="/images/project/Pylar/hardware.jpg" alt="hardware"/></p>
        <p>Code that receives and processes requests, </p>
        <figure class="highlight"><pre><code>include 'database.php';

if(isset($_GET['id'])){
    $name = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_GET["id"]);

    $id = $_GET["id"];
    $sql2 = "SELECT * FROM `user` WHERE `id` = $id;";
    $result2 = mysqli_query($conn, $sql2);
    $num = mysqli_num_rows($result2);

    if($num == 0){
        echo '{}';
    }else{
        $row = mysqli_fetch_array($result2);
        $entries = array("temp", "humidity", "battery", 
                    "airFlap", "tilt", "fill", "lastUpdate");
        $output = '{';

        foreach ($entries as &$value) {
            if($value == 'lastUpdate') {
                $output .= '"'.$value.'": "'.$row[$value].'",';
            } else {
                $output .= '"'.$value.'": '.$row[$value].',';
            }
        }

        $output = substr($output, 0, -1);
        $output .= '}';
        echo $output;
    }
            </code>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>This project is still in progress. And we already had 6 people from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pylar.io/">instagram</a> who want to invest in our project. 
    I'm happy with what we've done so far. </p>
