            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>In this research, I used the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html">COVID-19</a> time-series datasets from <a href="https://systems.jhu.edu/">CSSE</a> to find out
            if there is a correlation between the date of breakout and the total number of cases
            and if we can use machine learning to predict cases for future days. I used linear
            regression to model the relationship and found out that there is a correlation in
            these two aspects and AI did perform well on the number of cases in future days</p>
            <h4>How did I start</h4>
            <p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html">COVID-19</a> is impacting the world drastically and we are surprised how quickly it
            can spread globally. Different countries are experiencing different extend of the
            growing rate of the cases, and I’m curious to see if there’s any pattern between
            days of outbreak and the number of total cases. If there are, we can build an AI
            predictor to foresee the cases so that we’re more prepared for the next virus that
            is similar to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html">COVID-19</a>. And if people can input the number of total cases in the
            early days in the epidemic then they get the prediction of the future months, they
            can have a better understanding of what will happen so that we can be more
            prepared in the next epidemic</p>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <h4>Dataset</h4>
            <p>The dataset is by <a href="https://systems.jhu.edu/">CSSE</a> from <a href="https://www.jhu.edu/">John Hopkins University</a>. It contains the number of
            total COVID cases from 1/22/2020 to today of hundreds of areas around the world.
            It is 233 rows and 166 column CSV</p>
            <h4>Data Preparation and Cleaning</h4>
            <p>The different areas can have a different scale of cases due to various social
            conditions and populations. But my focus is on the growth rate and trends. When I
            train the linear regression on raw data, I received a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error#:~:text=In%20statistics%2C%20the%20mean%20squared,values%20and%20the%20actual%20value.">mean square error</a> of over
            10,000, which is extremely high compared to the scale of data. Then I decided to
            scale the cases of each area from 0 to 100. After that, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error#:~:text=In%20statistics%2C%20the%20mean%20squared,values%20and%20the%20actual%20value.">mean square error</a>
            dropped to 11, which I’m satisfied with. Also, China is the origin so its growth came
            earlier than anywhere else so I filtered out the rows of China for easier data
            preparation.</p>
        <h4>Research Questions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Is there any linear relationship between days of outbreak and the number of total cases?</li>
            <li>How well can machine learning predict total cases of future days?</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Methods</h4>
        <p>I plotted line graphs to see if there’s any potential of the correlation between days
of outbreak and the number of total cases. And I used linear regression to build a
machine learning model.</p>
            <h4>Finding</h4>
        <p>I used matplotlib library to plot the scaled total cases of three different countries along with the dates(outbreak days). I saw the similar trends from three graphs, which makes linear regression 
            possible to solve the prediction problem. Moreover, there’s pattern between the two aspects in this research. </p>

            <p><img src="/images/project/Analysis_on_predicting_COVID-19_cases/graph3.png" alt="graph3" /></p>
        <p>In the end, the linear regression gives a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error#:~:text=In%20statistics%2C%20the%20mean%20squared,values%20and%20the%20actual%20value.">mean square error</a> of 5.38e^-12 on prediction the most recent 10 days of total cases. 
            It demonstrates that machine learning is very good at solving problems like this.</p>

        <h4>Limitations</h4>
        <p>One of the limitations is that the different virus has a different level of spreading rate and incubation period. Thus, this model is only for viruses that are very closed to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html">COVID-19</a>.</p>
        <h3>Conclusions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>There are similar trends and the linear relationship of the growing total cases after breakout according to the graphs of different countries. </li>
            <li>Machine learning is helpful to this type of problem and yielded a low error in the end. </li>
        </ul>
